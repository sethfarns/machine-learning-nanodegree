A fundamental assumption (at least in most of our algorithms) is that our training and testing data are representative of data in the real world. IID = independent and identically distributed. Use cross-validation set as stand-in for test data, since using the test data would be cheating. Concept of folds. Helps avoid over-fitting, as cross-validation error will start to increase as over-fitting occurs.\n",
